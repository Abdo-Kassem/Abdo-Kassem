## 👋 Hi, I'm Abdelrahman Aboelkassem


🔧 I'm a backend developer with 2 years of experience building scalable web and mobile APIs using **Laravel**, **PHP**, and **MySQL**.  
🚀 Passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and solving real-world backend challenges like performance bottlenecks and race conditions.

🌱 Currently sharpening my skills in advanced **Back-end Development**, API optimization, and system design.
